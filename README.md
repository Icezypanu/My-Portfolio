# My-Portfolio
My practical projects including in-class and self-taught
 I am a student at Chiang Mai University. This is my portfolio that collects both of my previous projects and up-to-date projects. I will upload my practical projects on GitHub. You can see my journey of becoming a better data scientist. I will learn more and more. I never stop learning. If you have questions about me, contact me at panu.kia695@gmail.com. Thank you for your attention. Enjoy !!!
