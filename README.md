# My-Portfolio
My practical projects include in-class and self-taught. I have learned from many sources such as YouTube, Coursera, and others. Code might be like others because I always followed other's code along with my practice.
 I am a student at Chiang Mai University. This is my portfolio that collects both of my previous projects and up-to-date projects. I will upload my practical projects on GitHub. You can see my journey of becoming a better data scientist. I will learn more and more. I never stop learning. If you have questions about me, contact me at panu.kia695@gmail.com. Thank you for your attention. Enjoy !!!
